### What is this repository for? ###
This app is just some code I wrote to learn TDD, practice OOP and the Continous Integration Tool "scrutinizer-ci".

(I thought I'd keep it a bit interesting and learn a game, more chance of completing the projecting then)

### Rules of the game ###
*A new game is started.
*The Dealer gets cards from the card deck and shuffles them
*The Dealer then gives the cards one by one to each player
*The round begins and Player 1 goes first and selects a attribute of his card
*Player 2 reveales his cards value for the same attribute
*Whoever ever wins get to keep both cards and puts them at the bottom of their deck
*The new round begins with the winner of the last round
*The game ends when a players has no cards left

### Future Features ###
*Allow the ability to track how many rounds there have been
*Different difficulty bots
*Different packs of cards
*3 player games

### How do I get set up? ###
